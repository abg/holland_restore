This package provides a single command called 'mysqlrestore'. This command 
works on mysqldump output files and can extract particular items from a dump
file based on:

* database name
* table/view name
* table engine 

All filters are based on glob patterns, not regular expressions at present.

There are a few useful skip options as well:

* skip-routines to skip database routines (from mysqldump --routines)
* skip-binlog to add SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 0 (avoid writing a dump to the binlog)
* skip-triggers don't restore triggers

This code is structured in a flexible way and additional filtering can be added
with a little effort.
